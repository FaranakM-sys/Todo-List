# Todo-List
This is my first project in React using Typescript and Tailwind. My project Contains these stpes:
1.Show a static list of Todos
2.Add a Todo to the list
3.Remove one of the todos
4.Mark an item as done (the list should separate doneitems and undone ones)
5.The list should be sortable by title in both ways
